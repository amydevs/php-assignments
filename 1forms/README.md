## Question 3

1. Design a form that collects data for competition.
   
   

2. Outline the purpose of your form. Outline the elements being used on the form and why.
   
   The purpose of the form is to collect results for a leaderboard of an online arcade game. (Snake, etc.) Hence, why the page has been designed to include inputs for username, and score, with the date and time as well as index of the score's placement being calculated on-the-fly automatically.
   
   

3. Implement the form. Have a PHP processing page that displays the information in a formatted layout.
