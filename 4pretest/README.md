## Question 2

Try this example in your web browser using the supplied code below. Complete the table below before proceeding to the next activity.

| Enter Number | Expected Output                                                                                | Actual Output                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5            | Loop number;1 
<br />Loop number;2
<br />Loop number;3
<br />Loop number;4
<br />Loop number;5 | Loop number 0<br/>Loop number 1<br/>Loop number 2<br/>Loop number 3<br/>Loop number 4<br/>Loop number 5 |



Does the program produce the expected output? Why?

No, as the index for the loop starts at 0. Therefore, when counting from zero to five, there are 6 numbers including zero itself.



## Question 4

a) What is the code line $count = count + 1 doing? What is its purpose? 

The purpose is to iterate and increment the variable at each loop.



b) In the Algorithm the variable $count is set to zero at the beginning. What would happen if you set this to one?

If this were set to one at the beginning, the loop's iteration would start at one instead of zero. Hence the loop will start at 1, and end on the inputted value.
